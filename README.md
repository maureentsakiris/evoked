## A Story Map template to communicate climate services

> This template is still under development and will be made available in November 2020. Please contact us at evoked@geographie.uni-kiel.de for any inquiries. 

### Climate services
Climate services offer information about climate change. Ideally, they are science-driven and inform the user and follow a co-developing and production process, in a stepwise approach. Corresponding to that, instead of communicating in a top-down direction, user and provider should communicate and collaborate through climate services, in a two-way communication process.

### Story Map
In order to visualise and to communicate information about climate change we have produced a pilot story map as a climate service focusing on sea-level rise in the city Flensburg (Germany). As sea-level rise and the adaptation to potential impacts is quite a new topic to the city of Flensburg our story map has the goal to:

 - Raise awareness and inform about sea-level rise in Flensburg.
 - Contribute to decisions in dealing with local sea-level rise.
 - Support the adaptation process in Flensburg.
 
The target group of the story map is the general public. Further the story map has four main characteristics:

 - Usability: the story map should be easily understandable and usable.
 - Storytelling: the story map should tell a story.
 - Visualisation: the story map visualise the topic.
 - Translation: the story map translates complex information.
 
The pilot story map for Flensburg is accessible via: [meeresspiegelanstieg-in-flensburg.info](http://meeresspiegelanstieg-in-flensburg.info) 

#### General design
The general design of the Story Map template aims to mimic a story telling approach by creating a clear reading flow from top to bottom. Users who prefer to jump to a specific section can do so by expanding the menu. The template is optimised for desktop and handheld devices and its usability was tested to cater for users with different levels of computer literacy.

#### Components
The ready-made components reflect common use cases to communicate climate change information. Particular value was set on visualising geospatial information, e.g. in the context of a city, as well as providing an attractive form to collect user feedback.

> Detailed descriptions of the components and their usage will be included by November 2020

#### Usage
The template does not intend to provide an ‘out-of-the-box’ solution to create Story maps but rather a convenient starting point for development. It is highly adaptable to the different requirements each case study or use case will bring with. We recommend to seek the expertise of a communication designer to maximise its potential.
